Hi! I’m Martin. I currently earn a crust as an SEO consultant but I’m working hard towards my dream job as a front-end web developer. 

- 👀 I’m working on - gaining the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-ux-design" target="_blank">Google UX Design Certificate</a> on coursera.org, so I can develop web experiences that delight the user.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - everything it takes to be a front-end whizz with the Codecademy front-end engineer career path.
- 💞️ I’m looking to - levelup my React game with Epic React.
- 📫 Reach me at MartinHall.dev or studio[at]martinhall[dot]dev.
