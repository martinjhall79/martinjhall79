Hi! I’m Martin. I currently earn a crust as an SEO consultant but I’m working hard towards my dream job as a journalist specialising in data driven journalism. 

- 👀 I’m working on - gaining the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-ux-design" target="_blank">Google UX Design Certificate</a>, so I can develop web experiences that delight users.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - everything it takes to be a data journalism whizz, studying the <a href="https://www.nctj.com/qualifications-courses/qualifications/diploma-in-journalism/" target="_blank">UK Level 5 Diploma in Journalism by NCTJ</a>.
- 💞️ I’m looking to - levelup my data analysis game with <a href="https://epicreact.dev/" target="_blank">Certificate in Data Analysis With Python</a> by the excellent Free Code Camp.
- 📫 Reach me at MartinHall.press or hi[at]martinhall[dot]press.
