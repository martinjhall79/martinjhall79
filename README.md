Hi! I’m Martin. I currently earn a daily crust with digital marketing but I’m working like a Trojan towards my dream job, as a professional Unity developer.

- 👀 Working - on gaining the <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-certifications/professional-programmer" target="_blank">Unity Certified Professional Programmer</a>, so I can demonstrate expertise in coding.
- 🌱 Learning - everything it takes to be a VR development whizz, studying the excellent free courses at <a href="https://learn.unity.com/pathway/vr-development" target="_blank">Unity Learn - VR Pathway</a>, so I can immerse users in extraordinary experiences.
- 💞️ Loving - learning the basics of 3D art production with CGMA <a href="https://epicreact.dev/" target="_blank">Intro To Maya</a> course.
- 📫 Reach me at MartinHall.dev or hello[at]martinhall[dot]dev.
