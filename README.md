Hi! I’m Martin. I currently earn a crust as an SEO consultant but I’m working hard towards my dream job, to work as a journalist specialising in data driven stories. 

- 👀 I’m working on - gaining the <a href="https://www.nctj.com/qualifications-courses/qualifications/diploma-in-journalism/" target="_blank">UK Level 5 Diploma in Journalism by NCTJ</a>, so I know how to write stories that affect positive change.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - everything it takes to be a data journalism whizz, studying the excellent free courses at <a href="https://datajournalism.com/" target="_blank">DataJournalism.com</a>, so I can unearth truths buried deep in big data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to - levelup my data analysis game with <a href="https://epicreact.dev/" target="_blank">Certificate in Data Analysis with Python</a> by the excellent Free Code Camp.
